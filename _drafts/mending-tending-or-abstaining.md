If you grew up in California like me, then you learned about California history and the Spanish missions. Perhaps, like me, you took a field trip to see one and learn about them - how they were made, their purpose then and now, and the impact they had on the growth and development of the area. But in a classic American way the history taught in school skims over how the development of missions and other settlements was only possible due to the racist thinking that native peoples were less than the White settlers. It provided justification for the [forced marches](https://www.kcet.org/shows/california-coastal-trail/when-native-americans-were-forcibly-removed-from-a-mendocino-indian-reservation) and other tactics that removed native people from the land they were connected to and had built up centuries of knowledge about.
