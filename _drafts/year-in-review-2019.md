Link/restate some of the goals. Which ones were accomplished. What else did I do besides those things?

A little late to the game here since we're already a week into 2020, but I wanted to give a brief overview of what happened in 2019. It was a bit of an unusual year for me, but altogether positive. I got a job in January after over six months of searching, and it has been incredible. As a result, I feel like I've been able to settle into more of a routine than at any other point in the last five years. I went to Europe with my partner, visited one of my best and oldest friends in France, and had a great time traveling. I fractured my first bone ever while playing basketball, which was not fun at all, though I'm close to being fully healed. There some great times and a tougher times that, while I'd prefer to forget them, are learning experiences. Some friendships strengthened while other fell to the wayside. 

Enough vague anecdotes and let's evaluate how I did on my [goals of 2019](). The short answer: not well! The longer answer is that despite not doing so hot on some of my stated goals, I did make personal progress in other ways that was substantial. I completely flopped in the "Data Science/Statistics" category of my goals, and came close to being shut out of my "Basketball" set of goals, too. I discussed basketball philosophy through [analytics and its path](), which managed to be the only thing I wrote about my favorite sport.

The only category that saw even rudimentary levels of success was "Lifestyle/Other", and so I will go into a modicum of depth for it: 

* I finished over ten books and more than five non-fiction books, hitting both reading goals. My favorite books of the year were XXX and YYY and ZZZ. 
* I joined a gym, though it does not have a basketball court, let alone a way to  dead lift or squat with free weights (and I need to use the membership much more, anyhow). 
* I haven't eliminated single use plastic from my life, but I've certainly gotten better about it through the use of reusable bags and water bottles, as well as being gifted a reusable mug and straw. 
* I have gotten a bit better at cooking and show more often at my local market where I can get fresh ingredients without all the plastic packaging. 
* My on-again, off-again relationship with Duolingo continued that way this year. We are currently on and making slow progress to understanding pi√π italiano.

That's a lot of failure in terms of my goals. But if the year was a success in spite of these failures, something must have gone well, right? And several things definitely went well, chief among them my job.
