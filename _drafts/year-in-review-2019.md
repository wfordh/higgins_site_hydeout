A little late to the game here since we're already a week into 2020, but I wanted to give a brief overview of what happened in 2019. It was a bit of an unusual year for me, but altogether positive. I got a job in January after over six months of searching, and it has been incredible. As a result, I feel like I've been able to settle into more of a routine than at any other point in the last five years. I went to Europe with my partner, visited one of my best and oldest friends in France, and had a great time traveling. I fractured my first bone ever while playing basketball, which was not fun at all, though I'm close to being fully healed. There some great times and a tougher times that, while I'd prefer to forget them, are learning experiences. Some friendships strengthened while other fell to the wayside.

Enough vague anecdotes and let's evaluate how I did on my [goals of 2019](). The short answer: not well! The longer answer is that despite not doing so hot on some of my stated goals, I did make personal progress in other ways that was substantial. I completely flopped in the "Data Science/Statistics" category of my goals, and came close to being shut out of my "Basketball" set of goals, too. I discussed basketball philosophy through [analytics and its path](), which managed to be the only thing I wrote about my favorite sport.

The only category that saw even rudimentary levels of success was "Lifestyle/Other", and so I will go into a modicum of depth for it:

* I finished over ten books and more than five non-fiction books, hitting both reading goals. I really enjoyed most of the books I read this year, which included the last few Dark Tower books, Dune I, The Overstory, Sons & Lovers, Fooled by Randomness, and The Jungle Effect, among others.
* I joined a gym, though it does not have a basketball court, let alone a way to  dead lift or squat with free weights (and I need to use the membership much more, anyhow).
* I haven't eliminated single use plastic from my life, but I've certainly gotten better about it through the use of reusable bags and water bottles, as well as being gifted a reusable mug and straw.
* I have gotten a bit better at cooking and show more often at my local market where I can get fresh ingredients without all the plastic packaging.
* My on-again, off-again relationship with Duolingo continued that way this year. We are currently on and making slow progress to understanding pi√π italiano.

That's a lot of failure in terms of my goals. But if the year was a success in spite of these failures, something must have gone well, right? And several things definitely went well, chief among them my job. My team has been incredible as we've grown and it has given me a chance to grow, flex my skills, and dive into various areas of the business. It's helped me learn where I want to direct my career as well as more comfortable and confident in the nitty gritty parts of my job, which has in turn helped me in my personal projects. I got a _lot_ better at general coding in Python and know more about best practices, how to abstract code away in an appropriate manner, and handling a package.

One of my favorite pieces of the year has been learning more about how to leverage Github issues. I have never been great at creating project plans and sticking to them. When I try, I either get absurd laundry list of tasks or only have the big idea and fail to create any sort of checkpoints. Neither of those work well, and I believe that has contributed to some of my inability to produce work despite having (what I believe to be) decent to good ideas. I'm super excited to try and put some of this new planning to use, regardless of if it is with issues in Github or some other personal planning tool. I still have some things to learn about not overextending myself and saying no so that I allow myself enough time to do what I want to do, but I'm making steps in the right direction.

I learned a lot in 2019, both about myself and more technical skills, which excites when looking both back on the year and forward to 2020. I hope to have a companion piece to this one with my goals for 2020, which will be as ambitious as ever. I want to build on a fruitful year as much as possible, and hopefully I will be able to include some of y'all in it as much as possible. The world is vast and while I will never be able to tackle as much of it as I want to, it's about just making progress and earning your penny every day, no matter if it is directly relevant to your goal or not. Learn something new, regardless of if the source is a book, a YouTube video, a senior person at your company, or your friend's younger sibling.
