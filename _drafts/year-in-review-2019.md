Link/restate some of the goals. Which ones were accomplished. What else did I do besides those things?

A little late to the game here since we're already a week into 2020, but I wanted to give a brief overview of what happened in 2019. It was a bit of an unusual year for me, but altogether positive. I got a job in January after over six months of searching, and it has been incredible. As a result, I feel like I've been able to settle into more of a routine than at any other point in the last five years. I went to Europe with my partner, visited one of my best and oldest friends in France, and had a great time traveling. I fractured my first bone ever while playing basketball, which was not fun at all, though I'm close to being fully healed. There some great times and a tougher times that, while I'd prefer to forget them, are learning experiences. Some friendships strengthened while other fell to the wayside. 

Enough ambiguity and let's dive into my [goals of 2019]() to see how I did.
