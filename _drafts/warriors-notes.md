The Golden State Warriors are off to an interesting start to an interesting season. They have looked terrible for times and awesome during other stretches while having one of the least disrupted seasons thus far in terms of COVID. Putting aside questions of whether or not the NBA should even be playing right now, how are they looking so far and what might they do in the future, which means keeping the critiques of past roster decisions to a minimum.

They're sitting at 6-6 right now after last night's loss to Denver, which would put them in the play-in tournament if the season were to end today. However, they are sitting at [22nd in net rating](https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/advanced/?sort=NET_RATING&dir=-1) and aren't looking particularly deep after a couple of injuries. Let's start at the top of the roster though - Steph is generally doing Steph things, especially since Draymond returned. His shooting percentages are slightly down from his peak so far, but he has silenced the early critics after a few hot shooting nights. More than that, the rest of the team is starting to conform to his identity, which I think is due in large part to Draymond's return. Green provides another like minded player on the floor who is not afraid to get in anyone's face and has the credentials to back it up. He keeps both the ball and other players moving, which goes hand in hand with Curry's aesthetic.

The other players are gaining more comfort with this style, which is quite unlike most NBA and even college offenses. It's free flowing for the most part and Curry's talent forces his teammates to make snap decisions to screen, cut, or pass the ball in moments that simply don't happen elsewhere. There have already been many instances where Steph motions frantically for a player to set a screen for him to pop to the corner after giving the ball up, but the screen comes too late and Steph does not get open.

Kelly Oubre in particular has struggled with adjusting to this style of play, which is a bigger issue than his early shooting troubles. He's a fine shooter who will hit more threes and his defensive ability has been important to this team, but once he starts a drive, don't expect a productive pass out. It's more likely that he will throw up a shot regardless of the number of defenders near him or maybe dump the ball off, and that limited floor awareness limits his on ball ability and has been more glaring in this offense than in years past. All of that being said, I remain optimistic he will contribute positively to this team and be relied upon in the playoffs because of his mix of defense, rebounding, and shooting.

The bigger issue for the team's regular season hopes is the lack of a quality big man. James Wiseman has looked relatively good and is picking up details as the season progresses. His jumper is much sweeter than expected, though his free throw stroke casts some doubt on the jumper.
