It was supposed to be a big year for the A's, both on and off the field. The team was angling for yet another postseason run on the field and more progress towards a new stadium off of it. Instead, almost everything has gone wrong, including things both within and outside of their power, and the ramifications look to be far-reaching. Now the A's will have to make tough decisions about what their future holds considering the franchise had, at least from outside appearances, placed such a big bet on success in 2020. 

The team was set up to make a playoff run this year - Marcus Semien, the 2nd runner up for the 2019 AL MVP, is in a walk year. Prospects A.J. Puk, Jes√∫s Luzardo, and Sean Murphy had all shown glimpses of what they could down the stretch in 2019 and looked healthy and ready to contribute this year. The upper minors are chock full of potential role players and depth pieces ready to step in at a moment's notice. Sean Manaea was ready for a full year after missing most of 2019 and counting on Frankie Montas to keep his pre-PED suspension 2019 form. The A's were hoping for bounce back seasons from Khris Davis and Stephen Piscotty, and for Mark Canha to prove last year was no fluke. Clearly this year was targeted by A's brass as a potential peak for their current competitive window, which has also been my personal opinion for a while. And if the success materialized, then it would help propel the A's further down the road of a Howard Terminal site for the new stadium fans have been hearing about for years.
