It was supposed to be a big year for the A's, both on and off the field. The team was angling for yet another postseason run on the field and more progress towards a new stadium off of it. Instead, almost everything has gone wrong, including things both within and outside of their power, and the ramifications look to be far-reaching. Now the A's will have to make tough decisions about what their future holds considering the franchise had, at least from outside appearances, placed such a big bet on success in 2020.

The team was set up to make a playoff run this year - Marcus Semien, the 2nd runner up for the 2019 AL MVP, is in a walk year. Prospects A.J. Puk, Jes√∫s Luzardo, and Sean Murphy had all shown glimpses of what they could down the stretch in 2019 and looked healthy and ready to contribute this year. The upper minors are chock full of potential role players and depth pieces ready to step in at a moment's notice. Sean Manaea was ready for a full year after missing most of 2019 and counting on Frankie Montas to keep his pre-PED suspension 2019 form. The A's were hoping for bounce back seasons from Khris Davis and Stephen Piscotty, and for Mark Canha to prove last year was no fluke. Clearly this year was targeted by A's brass as a potential peak for their current competitive window, which has also been my personal opinion for a while. And if the success materialized, then it would help propel the A's further down the road of a Howard Terminal site for the new stadium fans have been hearing about for years.

Unfortunately, the ways it has gone wrong are at least as many as the reasons for optimism before COVID-19 hit. The pandemic has been the primary facilitator of the negativity and has lead to a protracted and ugly negotiation between the players' association on one side and the owners and commissioner's office on the other. Before the disputes on return to play reached their venomous peak though, the A's had already had a roller coaster ride through the shutdown. They decided [not to pay rent](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/05/19/oakland-as-skip-coliseum-rent-payment/) and followed that by a tone-deaf decision to not pay their (already underpaid) minor leaguers a $400 weekly stipend, though that has since [been reversed](https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/29272929/oakland-owner-admits-mistake-resume-paying-minor-leaguers). The decision to not pay minor leaguers was so bad that you almost wonder if MLB owners decided to draw straws as to who would do it so they could all see how it would go over before deciding upon it themselves. To say nothing of how this might impact future player acquisitions and general relations, these moves paint a stark financial picture and likely destroys the fans' faith that a new stadium will be built anytime soon.

What are the results and implications of the unraveling of the 2020 season for the A's? Best case scenario is the pandemic allows them to negotiate a below market free agent deal with Semien with the theory that he'll be able to stay close to home, and the Matts Chapman and Olson don't have salaries that skyrocket too fast once they hit arbitration. There does seem to be a world, as depressing as it would be, where they are both traded after 2021 (their first season with an arbitrated salary) to help replenish the farm system. If that does not happen, then pressure will be on the pro scouting department to continue finding players to fill out the rosters in three or four years since the amateur scouting and player development groups have been underwhelming.
