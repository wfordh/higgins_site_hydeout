The coronavirus is still running wild - wilder, even - and so we're all still stuck at home. It is a weird and trying time to live in the world, but I figure I'll still give an update on how the second quarter of the year went for me. I might have done even worse on my original goals this quarter compared to the first, but there were still some positives. I read two great non-fiction books, one good and interesting non-fiction book, one solid fiction book, and one terrible non-fiction book. Most of them were even on my list heading into the year! On top of that, I powered through the end of the algorithms course, though I definitely lost interest towards the end.
