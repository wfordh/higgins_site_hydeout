trip home

We did it. It was a little suspect at times - thanks, Texas - but my siblings and I made it back to the Bay Area. 

# The Planning

We cut the number of days on the road down to just five and chose a more southerly route, thinking we could avoid any bad winter weather that way. This was more important compared to the trip east because we were deeper into winter and would be driving a smaller SUV with an extra container on top and worse bad weather drivability. I was anxious about using the soft top container since it latched to the top using the doorframes and I had not driven with anything like that before.

The housing situation was a little harder on this route because the options in west Texas and New Mexico were rather sparse, but eventually we opted for three AirBNBs and a KOA as our stops. Each day would be between 8-10 hours making it tough to fit in a shorter recovery day. Unfortunately, we had already booked our stops when news broke about the winter storm whose path might intersect our own in Texas. After some debate, we decided to continue with our plan but carry some extra winter gear in case it was needed.

# The Execution

The first day was rather easy, though we hit the road later than planned. I was first to drive and took it slow in the beginning as we double and triple checked to make sure the container was staying attached to the car. We thankfully did not hit much traffic in Atlanta and kept on going through Alabama until we made it to Morton, Mississippi. Along the way we saw some hilarious signage for locations like Chunky, Lake, and Forest, as well as many telling Mississippians to "Pick it up". Ostensibly this is meant to discourage littering, but maybe it's telling them to move faster? Work harder? We had some fun coming up with different meanings on the way. Our place for the night was a cute little cabin across the street from a farm, and it was complete with fireplace, porch and deck, and a nice, big bathroom. In the morning I watched some of the cows over at the farm to see if any were transitioning, but no luck. It also wouldn't have felt quite right considering we weren't driving.

We hit the road early to try and make progress before hitting the inclement weather we were slated to hit at several points. The drive out of our AirBNB's neighborhood was eerie and evoked memories of the first season of True Detective with gnarled trees alone in big yards and giant houses next to trailer parks. I was happy to put that behind us, though the roadside nature through Louisiana was also foreign to me. Everywhere seemed halfway to being a full blown swamp and there were a lot of ferns covering the undergrowth, which I hadn't expected. It rained off and on through that passage, but then really picked up on the eastern side of Dallas. It was raining quite hard until we passed Fort Worth and caused some traffic, slowing us down before we even hit the snowy portion of the drive. My sister - an absolute dog lover - did the driving in this portion and we had to slow down and stop when she saw a dead dog that had been dumped on the shoulder, which added stress to an already arduous day.

I took over shortly after nightfall and we passed through Abilene. Several inches of snow had already fallen and our AirBNB was all the way in Odessa, three hours further west on I-20 in normal weather. However, it was not normal weather and there was no chance we would make it to Odessa, so we canceled that AirBNB and tried to find one closer. We found a spot in Snyder and booked it. I started driving on the snowy highway and the snow falling around us in the dark called to mind jumping to lightspeed in Star Wars. Our max speed in this stretch was maybe 38 or 40 mph and we passed several cars that had spun out on the shoulder. The slow progress meant that even Snyder was be too far and dangerous considering the state of the roads. Eventually we picked up some Dairy Queen for dinner, found a motel in Sweetwater, and settled in to wait out the storm.

Thankfully we woke up to beautiful, sunny skies and temperatures above freezing, lifting our spirits. The state of the roads, however, quickly dampened them. At best one of the two lanes on the interstate were open and at worst traffic was stopped for minutes on end. We moved over to frontage roads that Texas has alongside the interstate, which sped us up quite a bit and revealed the source of the slowdown: a half mile stretch were five or six big rigs were either stuck on snow and ice or had slid off the road. Locals with superpowered pickup trucks were pulling the trucks back onto the pavement, but cleanup crews were prevented from de-icing that stretch of road for quite a while. Some truck drivers had fun with it though, as we saw several hanging out and someone had made a snowman with caution flags for arms.

The rest of the Texas drive was rather uneventful. We passed through the oil fields and saw flares as gas was let off, but were eager to make it to our next stop in New Mexico. We settled into our KOA after 8 pm and took it easy that night after a couple of long and stressful days. The only notable thing about that stay was a nice and clear morning sky greeting us when we woke up. We hit the road again bound for the Palm Springs area, but planned to stop in Tucson to hit Saguaro National Park.

# Entertainment

We played the license plate game again and (fill in here). Our other primary entertainment was listening to the "Winds of Change" podcast investigating whether or not the Scorpions' internation hit "Wind of Change" was written by the CIA.
