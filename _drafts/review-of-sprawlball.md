For Kirk Goldsberry, nothing has changed. The NBA analyst known mostly for his hexagon-based shot charts wrote _Sprawlball_, a book promising to "capture the nature of this surreal time in the NBA" and presumably backing up his favorite catch phrase "[the game has changed](https://twitter.com/kirkgoldsberry/status/1250764411041652736)." However, like the "traditional" big men he eulogizes in the book, he has not displayed much of an ability to adapt. The book is repetitive and the first six chapters (of seven total) all contain more or less the same content, but with slight variations to his signature shot charts. In addition, it is full of false equivalences, hindsight bias, and misapplied context about the changes to the game that make it different from his ideal version of the sport, which is apparently the 2012-13 and 2013-14 San Antonio Spurs and maybe some teams from his youth.

It is a shame the book is so poorly executed because the game being played today is indeed different than what it was even 10 years ago, but Goldsberry spends the lion's share reiterating that in a doom and gloom manner without spending much time on what these changes may mean for the future. It prevents the book from accomplishing its goal of taking us "taking us on a visual tour of the modern NBA". The little time he does spend on the future is in the last chapter, easily the best and most interesting one, and yet even here everything is about how to change the rules so the game can look more like its past instead of what innovations may lie ahead. It is quite alright to not blindly sing the praises of the league and its product, but the criticisms included ring hollow and seem founded solely on nostalgia. This is odd considering the back cover promises celebration and beauty, but it was hard to see those elements anywhere on the pages.

The aesthetics of the book, despite these promises, are underwhelming. The graphs are generally pleasing to look at, and the artwork included is nice and breaks up the book well. Unfortunately these aren't enough to lift up the text itself, which is full of attempts at jokes and phrases such as "analytically woke" that fall flat. Nobody talks about being "analytically woke", and nobody should write like that, either. Repeating the same argument for several players with random quips and jabs about how modern players are somehow lesser than their predecessors makes it a tiring read. It prevents the interesting ideas and the reasons behind why Goldsberry believes this from bubbling to the surface. While data is not the end all, be all, he does not even provide a mental model for determining if today's game is indeed worse, and the data he does use - shot locations - is only reliable at a player level since about 2000 and does not accurately describe the many elements of the game that precede each shot. 

The charts themselves are often only the slightest of variations on each other and tell only a fraction of the story about how the shot charts were made by these players. Many readers already know that Stephen Curry turned into a three point shooting flamethrower in 2014-15 and then one-upped himself in 2015-16. They know LeBron lives at the rim, but had to add an outside shot to become fully formed in the modern game. It's easy to show this from the data since these players have only played since shot location data became more reliable. The league level charts don't dig any deeper, instead simply presenting the league-wide three point attempt rate and claiming that the recent uptick is horrendous, when the stat has been steadily been increasing since it came into existence. Goldsberry cites rule changes as a primary reason why this has happened, which is a good and accurate conclusion that is often overlooked, but assumes the rule changes and analytics are the only reasons behind the changes in the game. This is a great opportunity to poke deeper into how the changes are manifesting themselves in the game, but instead the author prefers to jump to another player and tell the same story again.

There are anecdotes about the modern NBA spread throughout the book, and several focus on the relationship between player salary and skill set, and how that has changed over time. Yet proper context is wholly missing from many of these, leaving the innocent reader to assume DeMarcus Cousins turned down strong multi-year deals in order to sign with Golden State in the summer of 2018, among other things. His favorite whipping boy is Ryan Anderson, who signed a four year, $64 million deal with Houston in the summer of 2016. Goldsberry does not provide adequate background facts to help explain why these things happened, such as Cousins suffering a notoriously difficult injury when he tore his Achilles earlier that year or that Anderson signed that deal when the cap spike occurred and many teams threw money around willy-nilly. The context does not completely explain some of these things or make them the correct decisions, but it helps the reader understand more of the situation and draw her own conclusions from it instead of following Goldsberry's agenda.
