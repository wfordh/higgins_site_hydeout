For Kirk Goldsberry, nothing has changed. The NBA analyst known mostly for his hexagon-based shot charts wrote _Sprawlball_, a book promising to "capture the nature of this surreal time in the NBA" and presumably backing up his favorite catch phrase "[the game has changed](https://twitter.com/kirkgoldsberry/status/1250764411041652736)." However, like the "traditional" big men he eulogizes in the book, he has not displayed much of an ability to adapt.
