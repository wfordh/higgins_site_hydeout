For Kirk Goldsberry, nothing has changed. The NBA analyst known mostly for his hexagon-based shot charts wrote _Sprawlball_, a book promising to "capture the nature of this surreal time in the NBA" and presumably backing up his favorite catch phrase "[the game has changed](https://twitter.com/kirkgoldsberry/status/1250764411041652736)." However, like the "traditional" big men he eulogizes in the book, he has not displayed much of an ability to adapt. The book is repetitive and the first six chapters (of seven total) all contain more or less the same content, but with slight variations to his signature shot charts. In addition, it is full of false equivalences, hindsight bias, and misapplied context about the changes to the game that make it different from his ideal version of the sport, which is apparently the 2012-13 and 2013-14 San Antonio Spurs and maybe some teams from his youth.

It is a shame the book is so poorly executed because the game being played today is indeed different than what it was even 10 years ago, but Goldsberry spends the lion's share reiterating that in a doom and gloom manner without spending much time on what these changes may mean for the future. The little time he does spend on the future is in the last chapter, easily the best and most interesting one, and yet even here everything is about how to change the rules so the game can look more like its past instead of what innovations may lie ahead. It is quite alright to not blindly sing the praises of the league and its product, but the criticisms included ring hollow and seem founded solely on nostalgia. This is odd considering the back cover promises celebration and beauty, but it was hard to see those elements anywhere on the pages.

The aesthetics of the book, despite these promises, are underwhelming. The graphs are generally pleasing to look at, and the artwork included is nice and breaks up the book well. Unfortunately these aren't enough to lift up the text itself, which is full of attempts at jokes and phrases such as "analytically woke" that fall flat.
