After waiting an extra month this year, the draft has finally happened! I'll go over how the A's did, a consensus board, and prospects I like more than the consensus.

# Consensus Board

I compiled the rankings from FanGraphs, Baseball America, Keith Law at the Athletic, Kiley McDaniel at ESPN, Prospects Live, MLB Pipeline, Baseball Prospectus (partial), [Jeff Ellis](https://mlbdraftnow.blogspot.com/2021/07/final-big-board-mlb-draft-2021.html), [Mason McRae](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MrXLOukRj_7ft2OALM8np4HemcIB9IyJ40yP4bfXXcY/edit#gid=641465746), [Michael Cook](https://mlbdrafthq.wordpress.com/2021/07/11/2021-mlb-draft-top-400-5-prospects/), and [Brian Recca](https://t.co/L12yHwXxnq?amp=1) into a consensus board. Yes, some of these are behind a paywall, but I only took the rankings and not the blurbs. I also really wish I could pay a smaller fee for just the rankings instead of monthly or yearly subscriptions. The only missing rankings are Perfect Game's Top 400, though their most recent list is from January and therefore out of date now.

The consensus board can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AEH4jEIZ_ShZjjbiW8vWb12YjNxqNj5M3OuvEFt-sgA/edit#gid=724638619).

# Oakland Recap

The A's continued their recent strategy by starting with a high potential, up the middle bat followed by college performers. Max Muncy started it off in the first round as one of only two high school draftees for them this year - the other being an intriguing, young, and big lefty from Puerto Rico, Eduardo Rivera - and while he's not the one I would've picked, I can't argue with it too much. He's seen as a solid bet to stay at shortstop and is hit over power right now, though he's nearly 19 already. It appears that he'll get a slightly overslot bonus to forgo a commitment to Arkansas.

In general the A's really focused on the West Coast in the top 10 rounds, with only three picks coming from elsewhere, including their second and third round picks. Zack Gelof is a third baseman from University of Virginia with untapped power potential while Mason Miller is an older pitcher from Gardner-Webb who is likely a reliever. The only other non-West Coaster was CJ Rodriguez, Vanderbilt's catcher who is a sure bet to stick back there but has 35 grade power at best. I was excited to get Denzel Clarke and Grant Holman in the 4th and 6th rounds, respectively. The rest of the players from the top 10 rounds were senior position players who are generally unexciting. Drew Swift can apparently pick it at shortstop but doesn't have much power and his plate discipline is subpar. Shane McGuire is Reese's brother and maintained good plate discipline while increasing his power the last two years. Jack Winkler and Brett Harris are more glove first players from the WCC.

Rounds 11 through 20 saw the A's pick bigger bodied pitchers with 8 of their 10 picks, with the only two position players being Jonny "Barrels" Butler from NC State and Mariano Ricciardi - J.P. Ricciardi's son - from Dayton. Butler, Rivera, and Mitch Myers are the most interesting from this group.

Overall it's an interesting group and the A's stuck to their m.o. by prioritizing up the middle position players and jumbo pitchers with a mix that skews towards college players, though they aren't afraid of taking players from smaller schools. 

# My Favorites

Trey Sweeney (SS) - up the middle, insane performance. Top 20 overall.

Ryan Holgate (OF) - good data. Round 2.

Gunnar Hoglund (RHP) - would've still had him top 12 even with TJS. Top 12.
