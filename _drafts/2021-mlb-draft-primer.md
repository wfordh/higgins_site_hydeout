After waiting an extra month this year, the draft is right around the corner! I'll go over some things to expect from the A's, a consensus board, and prospects I like more than the consensus.

# What to Expect From the A's

1st pick - chase upside, likely in a high school hitter

2nd pick - college arm with a good changeup and preferably from a major conference

College rest of the way with one or two high school hitters and one high school pitcher. Typically at least one small school performer

# Consensus Board

I compiled the rankings from FanGraphs, Baseball America, Keith Law at the Athletic, Kiley McDaniel at ESPN, Prospects Live, MLB Pipeline, Mason McRae, and Brian Recca into a consensus board. Yes, some of these are behind a paywall, but I only took the rankings and not the blurbs. I also really wish I could pay a smaller fee for just the rankings instead of monthly or yearly subscriptions. The only missing rankings are Baseball Prospectus's Top 50 and Perfect Game's Top 400, though PG's most recent list is from January and therefore out of date now.

# My Favorites

Simply put, players I like more than most of the other lists.
