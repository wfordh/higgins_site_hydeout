The 2020 MLB Draft will start this Wednesday in a modified five round format to account for COVID-19 and its impact on the league. To keep it succinct - I do not think this is in the best long term interests of the sport. Of course, while you have to avoid ruin in the short term to worry about the long term, I don't think the sport of baseball is in any real danger of that (except from the team owners who seem hellbent on falling further behind the NBA and NFL). 

The A's, as you probably know, are at the center of this considering their decision to not pay minor leaguers, though they have since decided against this and to move forward with paying them. As a human, I am happy John Fisher decided to do this, as even $400/week can help immensely when you are making very little money otherwise. Of course, I would love for the players to be paid more than that, but it's better than nothing. As a fan, however, I am certainly worried that the always cost conscious A's just put a huge target on their back and that moving forward with the payments will not undo the PR damage around the league. This will manifest itself in several ways, including draft prospects likely floating higher signing bonus numbers to the A's than they do to other organizations. I would not be surprised if the A's (or Angels) also cut deals by significantly overdrafting players in order to save money.

Anyway, venturing into our happy world and assuming these things will not factor into the draft, let's prognosticate on who I like more than consensus as well as who I think the A's might pick. They have the 26th pick overall, followed by numbers 58, 98, 127, and 157 for a total bonus pool amount of $5,241,500. I will reiterate that, as always, I am not a professional, though I did recently read [Future Value by Eric Longenhagen and Kiley McDaniel](https://www.triumphbooks.com/future-value-products-9781629377674.php) and highly recommend it.

I think the top options for the A's here are college hitters with tools and, though they haven't often lead with college pitching, it's also an option. They've recently leaned tools, some modicum over performance, and some defensive chops over their previous reliance on pure performance, and the only two pitchers they've taken in the first round in the last 10 years are Sonny Gray and AJ Puk, both of whom slid down the board on draft day. They've also typically stayed away from taking chances on Northeast and Midwest players early in the draft, preferring the Southeast, Texas, and California.

This leaves me with a handful of options for projecting who the A's will pick:

* Jordan Westburg, SS, Mississippi St
* Dillon Dingler, C, Ohio St
* Aaron Sabato, 1B, UNC
* Casey Martin, SS, Arkansas
* Freddy Zamora, SS, Miami
* Nick Loftin, SS, Baylor
* Justin Foscue, 2B/3B, Mississippi St

I think Zamora would be a bit of an overdraft, though they haven't been shy about that in the past (Matt Chapman, Richie Martin, Austin Beck, Kyler Murray, and Addison Russell were all considered reaches to varying degrees). Loftin feels a lot like Chad Pennington, while Westburg has major Logan Davidson vibes. Casey Martin is a tooled-up likely SS who sells out for power, but really struggled to start the year. Sabato is a right/right first baseman who has absolutely mashed in his first two years at UNC while showing plate discipline. Dingler is a converted C who doesn't seem likely to reach the A's, despite being defensively focused and robot umps seemingly inevitable. 

There's also a slew of college right handers, and picking from that group is nigh impossible as it will likely come down to a combination of who is available and who the A's were able to see before the shutdown. The list includes, but is not limited to, Slade Cecconi, Bobby Miller, Chris McMahon, Tanner Burns, Carmen Mlodzinski, CJ Van Eyk, and Bryce Jarvis. Personally, Cecconi and Jarvis are the most appealing of that group.

I would be pretty happy with Dingler and satisfied with Zamora or Foscue, but ecstatic with either Pete Crow-Armstrong (HS CF) or Ed Howard (HS SS). Crow-Armstrong seems to be rising up boards late, while Howard is falling for some reason, despite being a guaranteed shortstop with some feel for hitting who is about average in age for his class and from a cold weather state. 

Dingler, PCA, and Howard are some of the best players that I seem to like more than the consensus, along with a slew of other players: Carson Tucker, Nick Yorke, Casey Schmitt, Alex Freeland, Werner Blakely, Ben Ramirez, Freddy Zamora, Carson Taylor, Chase Davis, Kyle Harrison, Stevie Emanuels, TJ Nichols, Kala'i Rosario, Jacob Misiorowski, Gino Groover, Grayson Hitt, Jaren Shelby, Jamal O'Guinn, Brandon McIlwain, Steven Ondina, Jordan Walker, Blake Dunn, Petey Halpin, Levi Prater.
