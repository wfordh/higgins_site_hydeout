The calendar flipped over a few weeks back and 2020 is in full swing, which means it's time for me to finally complete and release my to-do list for the year. I don't think I can still wish anyone "Happy New Year", but hopefully that doesn't get in the way of the ethos of the post. I'm looking forward to this year as a chance to build on a [strong 2019](https://fordhiggins.com/miscellaneous/2020/01/17/year-in-review-2019.html) and continue learning and getting better at the things that interest me. It is the first time in quite a while that I'm feeling stable heading into a year, which is really exciting and gives me confidence. 

In general, I want to continue improving and learning and execute more of my own projects using the skills and knowledge that I acquire. I am assigning some of the more technical goals into specific quarters of the year for me to focus on them, while other goals will remain more open regarding when I work on them.
