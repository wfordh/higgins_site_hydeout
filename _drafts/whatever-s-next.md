ProtonVPN, job update, pupdate, gormenghast, planning trips, brackets, being sick & vaccines, 

Things have been a little crazy around here recently and what time I have has been devoted to several projects, so I haven't written in a while. I want to get back to it and it seems like a summary is the best way to get writing again, so here goes. 

I am back to the job search after the part time job I was at ended up not being the fit for me, but it's been tough to get it going. I'm certainly waiting a little bit on a potential opportunity to work again for my manager from Scoop, but I was also feeling under the weather for a couple weeks and did not want to be interviewing with a cough and sore throat. Fortunately I am almost entirely over that and have now received both doses of the COVID-19 vaccine! The first one was very easy and just resulted in a small bruise and some soreness. I was anxious about the second because it coincided with my cough, but the side effects for it were rather mild, too, as I was lethargic and sore the next day until the early afternoon.

Besides that it's been a lot of planning trips to Mendocino, Seattle, and Hawaii, watching the wild men's NCAA Tournament
