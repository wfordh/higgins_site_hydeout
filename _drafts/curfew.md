Lights out at eight.  
Don’t be a second late  
Making it back home  
Because even if you keep your hands up,  
You may end up one with the loam.

I feel like we’re living in a surreality  
Helicopters buzzing overhead  
Rights being limited. Voices silenced.  
Experiencing it for the first time, this sense of dread.  
Am I getting a glimpse of others’ reality?

The sirens scream and wail  
In the background as I peek through the cracked door,  
Forced wide open for all to see, to witness, and to accept the extent of our crimes.  
A video plays, showing yet another black person forced to the floor.  
I watch, knowing that despite seeing, my skin protects me as I write these rhymes,  
As if I'm wearing an unjustly made suit of white chain mail.

I march and offer my support,  
Struggling to fight down my white guilt  
Knowing the ball is in our court  
To ally with our black brothers and sisters as we get this country rebuilt  
Without commandeering the spotilight or letting a movement wilt

The key turns. I hear the church bells chime 8 o'clock as I walk up the stairs.  
Exhausted, yet amazed. The strength, endurance, and persistence  
To keep moving despite the pain and pass it down to their heirs  
It invigorates me, knowing they press on.  
Tomorrow, and the next day, and the next, they'll get my energy, until racism is gone.  
Because for real change, we must go the distance.
