Lights out at eight.  
Don’t be a second late  
Making it back home  
Because even if you keep your hands up,  
You may end up one with the loam.

I feel like we’re living in a surreality  
Helicopters buzzing overhead  
Rights being limited. Voices silenced.  
Experiencing it for the first time, this sense of dread.  
Am I getting a glimpse of others’ reality?
