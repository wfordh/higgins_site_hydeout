Henri Thangorin Stullecker is my fourth Dungeons and Dragons character and is part of my second campaign with some friends from grad school. I will provide backstory and other details of Henri in this introduction, and finish it off with a brief monologue for right before the campaign starts. It is set in a time of civil unrest in the country of Aylin, and the curtains lift on the characters while they sit down in a tavern in Galimbrah.

***

Henri was born in the year (37 years prior to today) to a Drow mother and human father while they were on the road in their traveling troupe. His father, Adrien Stullecker, was an oft-leading man and the primary medic for the group, while his mother, Idruith Eldrea, was the main craftswoman and helped barter with taverns when they reached towns.
