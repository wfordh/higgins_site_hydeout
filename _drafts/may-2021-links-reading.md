It's been a while since I've written anything, so figured a link dump of what I've been enjoying would be a good way to get back on track. The links will encompass articles, podcasts, and whatever else merits being passed along.

# Podcasts / Videos

* [**Wayfarer's Guide to World-Building**](https://www.mythosink.com/podcast/)**:** After listening to [N.K. Jemisin talk about world building with Ezra Klein](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6xyFQhbsjQ), I decided to look for more resources on the topic. I've always loved fantasy and sci-fi novels, and coming up with my own world has long been a fantasy of its own. I found this podcast by Mythos & Ink, an independent SFF publisher in Canada, and have really enjoyed it so far. Their approach is more through examples than their own work, but they provide questions to ask yourself about each topic and make it fun.
* **Ottobot** and **Playing Ottoneu**: I am diving even deeper on fantasy baseball this year and started listening to Ottobot, Ottoneu's official podcast, as well as Playing Ottoneu, a fancast by a member of one of my leagues. It's a 20 team Ottoneu league - the only of its kind - and the podcast's host, Miguel, is one of the other managers in the league. It's a super fun podcast that typically includes some personal stories of fandom and his fantasy teams, followed by an interview with someone else in the 20 team league about their own journey and the unique challenges of the league. Spoiler alert - my brother and I will be on an upcoming episode!
* [**SLICED**](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1042917748): Full disclosure, I haven't watched this yet, but it just seems super cool and my friend Canzhi won the first episode!
