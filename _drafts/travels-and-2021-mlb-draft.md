Alright let's talk about a couple of totally unrelated things - my recent travels and the 2021 MLB Draft.

# Travel

My partner and I recently traveled to Seattle and then Hawai'i. It was my first time in both spots and we spent three full days in Seattle and four in Hawai'i. High level takeaway is both are very cool and would recommend seeing each one if possible!

## Seattle

We flew up to Seattle - my first time flying since pre-pandemic - and it was a whirlwind trip. I got to see some friends from college as well as my brother and his partner while staying in the cute West Seattle neighborhood. I enjoyed the scenery and nature across the city as we visited Seward Park, Gas Works, the Ballard Locks, and several neighborhoods. We saw the city skyline at night and Bainbridge Island at dusk from West Seattle, and in the city we would turn a corner and see the surrounding mountains and lakes.

The food and drinks were delicious, too, though we had a terrible brunch at Easy Street Records despite maybe seeing Sue Bird walk past (it was tough to tell with the masks).

# 2021 MLB Draft

This is shaping up to be a weird draft thanks to all the oddities caused by the pandemic. There are some solid players in it, but this year does seem a bit weaker at the top than other years. In my unprofessional eyes, the top players in the draft are:

1. Henry Davis
2. Marcelo Mayer
3. Kahlil Watson
4. Jack Leiter
5. Brady House
6. Kumar Rocker

After that it isn't super clear to me - I'm not a big fan of Jordan Lawler and am not sure which of the next group of college hitters I like the most, though I think Gunnar Hoglund would be either 6 or 7 if he hadn't gotten hurt. I really like the top 3 though, and may bump reorganize them before the draft.

I've had a harder time zeroing in prospects in the A's range that are favorites than is typical, but I bucketed some players based on how I'd feel if the A's drafted them.

* Love: Trey Sweeney, Will Taylor, Harry Ford
* Like: Michael McGreevy, Carson Williams, Jud Fabian, Will Bednar, Izaac Pacheco, Gage Jump
* Fine: Jay Allen, Aaron Zavala, Ryan Cusick, Alex Binelas, Lonnie White Jr.,

Some others that I wouldn't expect to be the first round pick, but could be around in the second are Davis Diaz, Thatcher Hurd, Josh Hartle, Ryan Bliss, James Wood, Edwin Arroyo, Ky Bush, and Doug Nikhazy, among others. I'll probably post a list of all the guys I'm higher on than consensus at some point, as well as a consensus board made from ones posted online.

One last note is that the A's scouts definitely deserve some credit, at least for the Soderstrom pick last year. He's been absolutely killing it. Logan Davidson is more of a mixed bag, getting a 50 from [MLB Pipeline](https://www.mlb.com/prospects/athletics/logan-davidson-669722), a 45 from [Prospects Live](https://www.prospectslive.com/lists/2021/2/14/oakland-athletics-2021-prospect-rankings), and a [40 from FanGraphs](https://www.fangraphs.com/prospects/the-board/2021-prospect-list/summary?sort=-1,1&team=oak). He seems sure to stick at SS despite Nick Allen's presence and he's been better of late in Double-A Midland where he's 1.2 years younger than the average player in the league and having only played in short season ball before this year thanks to the pandemic. However, wood bats seem to sap all power from him, which could result in a walk-driven profile despite his 6'3" 215 lb frame.
