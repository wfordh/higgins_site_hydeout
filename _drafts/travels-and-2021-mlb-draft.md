Alright let's talk about a couple of totally unrelated things - my recent travels and the 2021 MLB Draft.

# Travel

My partner and I recently traveled to Seattle and then Hawai'i. It was my first time in both spots and we spent three full days in Seattle and four in Hawai'i. High level takeaway is both are very cool and would recommend seeing each one if possible!

# 2021 MLB Draft

This is shaping up to be a weird draft thanks to all the oddities caused by the pandemic. There are some solid players in it, but this year does seem a bit weaker at the top than other years. In my unprofessional eyes, the top players in the draft are:

1. Henry Davis
2. Marcelo Mayer
3. Kahlil Watson
4. Jack Leiter
5. Brady House
6. Kumar Rocker

After that it isn't super clear to me - I'm not a big fan of Jordan Lawler and am not sure which of the next group of college hitters I like the most, though I think Gunnar Hoglund would be either 6 or 7 if he hadn't gotten hurt. I really like the top 3 though, and may bump reorganize them before the draft.

I've had a harder time zeroing in prospects in the A's range that are favorites than is typical, but I bucketed some players based on how I'd feel if the A's drafted them.

* Love: Trey Sweeney, Will Taylor, Harry Ford
* Like: Michael McGreevy, Carson Williams, Jud Fabian, Will Bednar, Izaac Pacheco, Gage Jump
* Fine: Jay Allen, Aaron Zavala, Ryan Cusick, Alex Binelas, Lonnie White Jr., 

Some others that I wouldn't expect to be the first round pick, but could be around in the second are Davis Diaz, Thatcher Hurd, Josh Hartle, Ryan Bliss, James Wood, Edwin Arroyo, Ky Bush, and Doug Nikhazy, among others. I'll probably post a list of all the guys I'm higher on than consensus at some point, as well as a consensus board made from ones posted online. 

One last note is that the A's scouts definitely deserve some credit, at least for their last couple first round picks.
