The first quarter of 2020 caused a lot of emotional stress thanks to COVID-19, the death of Kobe Bryant and the end of his complicated life, and changes at my company. I will touch on some of those things as well as provide updates on some of my Q1 goals (hint: they're a work in progress). This might jump around a bit since it will cover some of atypical things, but we'll get through it alone together, sort of how we're getting through the shelter-in-place orders due to COVID-19.

It is somewhat expected, but the fact I have to stay in my apartment except to get groceries, do laundry, and occasionally walk around helps me make progress on my goals. I now don't have a commute and can't make weekend plans, so I am left to do the things that I want to accomplish. There are no longer any distractions, besides Netflix and online shopping (definitely doing more of that than ever before). Sports are not really a thing for the time being and I have so far avoided resorted to video games. 

This is important and, hopefully without making it sound like an excuse, a big reason I have been able to work on projects. I am a person who feels a lot of responsibility to those that I am around and want to make sure others feel their time is valued by me. Obviously I think this is a good thing and one of my better traits, but it means I don't always do what I want to do.
