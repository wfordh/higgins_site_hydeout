The first quarter of 2020 caused a lot of emotional stress thanks to COVID-19, the death of Kobe Bryant and the end of his complicated life, and changes at my company. I will touch on some of those things as well as provide updates on some of my Q1 goals (hint: they're a work in progress). This might jump around a bit since it will cover some of atypical things, but we'll get through it alone together, sort of how we're getting through the shelter-in-place orders due to COVID-19.

It is somewhat expected, but the fact I have to stay in my apartment except to get groceries, do laundry, and occasionally walk around helps me make progress on my goals. I now don't have a commute and can't make weekend plans, so I am left to do the things that I want to accomplish. There are no longer any distractions, besides Netflix and online shopping (definitely doing more of that than ever before). Sports are not really a thing for the time being and I have so far avoided resorted to video games.

This is important and, hopefully without making it sound like an excuse, a big reason I have been able to work on projects. I am a person who feels a lot of responsibility to those that I am around and want to make sure they feel their time is valued by me. I'm clearly biased and consider it one of my better traits, but it means I don't always do what I want to do. However, I'm taking advantage of this opportunity to do more of the things I planned on doing and going after more things from my start of year to-do list.

My progress has been solid in some parts, though a bit lacking in others. I researched credit cards and savings account, but have yet to commit to any in particular, though I finally picked a password manager. I went with [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) and am happy with it so far. I have switched most of my personal laptop browser usage to Firefox, but not yet all. I have not ordered take out much to date this year, but that may grow more difficult with COVID-19.

I am making good progress on my book list so far this year, finishing _Children of Dune_, _Dune Messiah_, _Hello World_, and, most recently, _Everything and More_. Next up will be _Range_ and _Sprawl Ball_, probably followed by some fiction. The shelter-in-place order from COVID-19 shut down libraries, which will make it tougher to get some books and also force me to start using my Kindle to rent e-books. 

Work on the technical pieces came slower than hoped, but I'm getting there.

Kobe Bryant had a complicated life and legacy, and I leave it to better writers than I to tackle that. However, I will say that the crash causing the death of Kobe and his daughter Gianna hit me a lot harder than expected. I was never a Kobe fan, but it took me a while to read and watch some of the articles and clips remembering him and his daughter.
