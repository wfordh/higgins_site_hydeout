Henri Thangorin Stullecker is my fourth Dungeons and Dragons character and is part of my second campaign with some friends from grad school. I will provide backstory and other details of Henri in this introduction, and finish it off with a brief monologue for right before the campaign starts. It is set in a time of civil unrest in the country of Aylin, and the curtains lift on the characters while they sit down in a tavern in Galimbrah.

***

Henri was born in the year 894 to a Drow mother and human father while they were on the road in a traveling troupe with people from many races and backgrounds. His father, Adrien Stullecker, was a craftsman and the primary medic for the group, while his mother, Idruith Eldrea, was an oft-leading woman and helped barter with taverns when they reached towns. Henri could often be found practicing stage combat with the other children, helping his father with the group's medical needs, or engaging in a battle of wits with his mother.

Unfortunately, an illness swept through the troupe when Henri was 11, killing Adrien and forcing the troupe to disband. Idruith took Henri back to her hometown of Northbury and took a job with a cordwainer as she continued to act at a local theatre. During these years, Henri took an interest in the written word and attended as much school as possible while still helping his mother. She recognized his interests and began tutoring him in languages learned from fellow troubadours. He was intensely curious and harbored a wish to learn medicine and save people from future illnesses, and delved into the languages, philosophy, and the history of medicine in his studies. 

Henri was invited to study at university in Elkavar when he came of age and left his mother behind in Northbury. He struggled to establish himself socially despite often receiving top marks, developing close relationships with only a couple of students and professors. He was teased for his half-elf heritage, which was clear thanks to his possessing uncommon height and facial hair for a pure elf, and his relative lack of wealth thanks to his peers at the prestigious school. This pushed him to focus on research as he scoured the library for answers to his many questions, only sharing what he learned once his research was complete.
