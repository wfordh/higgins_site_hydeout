Henri Thangorin Stullecker is my fourth Dungeons and Dragons character and is part of my second campaign with some friends from grad school. I will provide backstory and other details of Henri in this introduction, and finish it off with a brief monologue for right before the campaign starts. It is set in a time of civil unrest in the country of Aylin, and the curtains lift on the characters while they sit down in a tavern in Galimbrah.

***

Henri was born in the year 894 to a Drow mother and human father while they were on the road in a traveling troupe with people from many races and backgrounds. His father, Adrien Stullecker, was a craftsman and the primary medic for the group, while his mother, Idruith Eldrea, was an oft-leading woman and helped barter with taverns when they reached towns. Henri could often be found practicing stage combat with the other children, helping his father with the group's medical needs, or engaging in a battle of wits with his mother.

Unfortunately, an illness swept through the troupe when Henri was 11, killing Adrien and forcing the troupe to disband. Idruith took Henri back to her hometown of Northbury and took a job with a cordwainer as she continued to act at a local theatre. During these years, Henri took an interest in the written word and attended as much school as possible while still helping his mother. She recognized his interests and began tutoring him in languages learned from fellow troubadours. He was intensely curious and harbored a wish to learn medicine and save people from future illnesses, and delved into the languages, philosophy, and the history of medicine in his studies.

Henri was invited to study at the lower university in Elkavar when he came of age and left his mother behind in Northbury. He struggled to establish himself socially despite often receiving top marks, developing close relationships with only a couple of students and professors. He was teased for his half-elf heritage, which was clear thanks to his uncommon height, physique, and facial hair for a pure elf, and his relative lack of wealth thanks to his peers at the prestigious school. This pushed him to focus on research as he scoured the library for answers, only sharing his findings once his research was complete. He completed his thesis on the effects of language on medical treatment and decided to continue his studies at the upper university in the hopes of reaching professorship.

Part of his motivation to further his studies was gaining access to the libraries of the upper university in the hopes of uncovering more hidden truths of the world. His focus turned to practicing medicine and searching for lost remedies through old texts from across the continent, and although he had never been a religious person thanks to his time with his parents' troupe, he found religious texts often contained whispers of medicinal advice. He began traveling the continent searching for rare books on behalf of the school while practicing medicine in the towns along the way, which encouraged him to learn even more tongues. Henri became professionally obsessed with ideas of how language influenced medicine through his relationship with his patients, and personally obsessed with his patients' willingness to share secrets whilst being treated.

Unfortunately, during a trip to Murk Mellow he received word that his mother was maimed in an accident at the shoe shop that left her unable to walk, and thus unable to act. Guilt-ridden but unwilling to leave his studies, Henri stopped traveling and began splitting his time between Elkavar and Northbury. His work slacked due to the stress, and the university halted his studies, offering him an opportunity to tie up his work and become an individual lecturer (ie he is employed by the university, but teaches and is paid by individual students) instead of full professor.

After another session with a frustrating student, Henri decided to return to the library to distract himself. He bemoaned the fact that a ne'er-do-well could be accepted into the university solely because of his family's stature and angry with himself that he could not find a way to properly communicate with the student. His research into how language influences learning and his communication with students and patients had taken many turns leading nowhere, and he was eager to channel his irritation at the student into inspiration. As he turned a corner to continue down another candlelit stone corridor, however, the flames guttered and went out. 

The stone walls, now only lit by moonlight, faded and disappeared from view. In their place was a large figure, clothed in a flowing, deep purple robe and blocking the hall

next: skip forward in time to meeting with Grendulias, which occurs while researching his interest in philosophy of language and secrets (or something). This catapults him on the journey, which began \~5 months ago. Despite agnostic life and relative lack of interest in non-healing magic before this, his meeting with Grendulias convinces him of both higher beings and the power of magic, and he feels a pull to discover ??? (whatever Grendulias mentions to him). He is motivated to buy shield, armor, and mace, and draws on his memories stage fighting to inform his now urgent need to wield a weapon.
