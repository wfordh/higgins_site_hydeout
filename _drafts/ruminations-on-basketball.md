Analytics was always going to happen. It didn't ruin anything. We ended up at the most likely point, though maybe faster than expected thanks to technological advances.

Has analytics slowed the rate of rule changes? How teams figure out the system quicker than ever and why that means we need to shake it up. The role of analytics and the desire for standardization.

Changes to the game and how it is played.

Changes to the game w/r/t how it is produced and presented.

Impact vs Talent: role of analytics (and eye test?) small blurb on how contract is inextricably linked to both of them

Path dependence, randomness, fat tails, negative vs positive payoffs, etc Taleb ideas in basketball

Global vs local optima

Basketball on Paper was published 15 years ago. ESPN's Real Plus-Minus was introduced five years ago. The Sloan Sports Analytics Conference is over 10 years old. It is clear that basketball analytics has a firm foothold in the greater world of basketball and is here to stay. However, was it always going to be like this? Are there other possible histories where analytics did not become a part of the basketball ecosystem?

I intend to explore these questions here and related branches of thought in subsequent pieces, meant to take a critical look at the state of the NBA today. The pieces will primarily  concern the role of analytics and its influence on the game, but they will be varying degrees of technical and will generally rely more on heuristics than hard numbers. Although I have a rough outline of ideas I want to cover in these pieces, part of the fun will be seeing which new branches sprout up as we move through these meditations. Now on to the fun part - was analytics as it was known today always going to happen?

Let's not bury the lede here - some iteration of analytics was always going to happen. It's well documented that coaches such as Dean Smith used statistics to better track, measure, and evaluate team performance, which in turn influenced team strategy. That level of analytics has had a place in the game for a long time and would have continued to, even without the technical revolution that has allowed for innovation in many different industries, not just sports. 

Video tech and video coordinators.
