Analytics was always going to happen. It didn't ruin anything. We ended up at the most likely point, though maybe faster than expected thanks to technological advances.

Has analytics slowed the rate of rule changes? How teams figure out the system quicker than ever and why that means we need to shake it up. The role of analytics and the desire for standardization.

Changes to the game and how it is played.

Changes to the game w/r/t how it is produced and presented.

Impact vs Talent: role of analytics (and eye test?) small blurb on how contract is inextricably linked to both of them

Path dependence, randomness, fat tails, negative vs positive payoffs, etc Taleb ideas in basketball

Global vs local optima

Basketball on Paper was published 15 years ago. ESPN's Real Plus-Minus was introduced five years ago. The Sloan Sports Analytics Conference is over 10 years old. It is clear that basketball analytics has a firm foothold in the greater world of basketball and is here to stay. However, was it always going to be like this? Are there other possible histories where analytics did not become a part of the basketball ecosystem?

I intend to explore these questions here and related branches of thought in subsequent pieces, meant to take a critical look at the state of the NBA today. The pieces will primarily  concern the role of analytics and its influence on the game, but they will be varying degrees of technical and will generally rely more on heuristics than hard numbers. Although I have a rough outline of ideas I want to cover in these pieces, part of the fun will be seeing which new branches sprout up as we move through these meditations. Now on to the fun part - was analytics as it was known today always going to happen?

Let's not bury the lede here - some iteration of analytics was always going to happen. It's well documented that coaches such as Dean Smith used statistics to better track, measure, and evaluate team performance, which in turn influenced team strategy. There were other possible paths for analytics to have taken up to this point, but the current state strikes me as one of the most common outcomes. The timeline was perhaps sped up a bit thanks to the overall progressive nature of the league, especially under Adam Silver, compared to other leagues, but something akin to this state is likely regardless of the path. 

The level of analytics utilized by Smith and others has had a place in the game for a long time and would have continued to have a role at every level. Coaches are responsible for winning games, and winning games requires finding an optimal strategy for your roster. Sure, the technical revolution with computing power has allowed for innovation both within sports and other industries, but that simply sped up the innovation. It didn't create analytics and the associated roles with teams out of nothing any more than the advent of video technology lead to the proliferation of video scouts and coordinators.

A common critique of analytics is that it "ruins the game", or sucks the fun out of it in some way. Analytics has simply illuminated some pathways to innovation that were previously unseen, and discouraged the game from exploring other paths. The driving forces behind advancements in the game have always been coaches trying to fit the unique talents of their players to the rules of the game. Chances are a Steph Curry-like shooter would have come along at some point anyway, and the right coach paired with that player would have given us similar results to the Curry/Kerr pairing (though Curry was certainly already elite prior to Kerr). 

Or maybe a different revolutionary player would come instead and the game would have taken a different turn. Maybe that happens five years later. Who knows. It's all possible, but the point here is that it's possible irrespective of analytics. What it really depends on are the players, the rules, and the coaches (we'll explore the rules aspect in another piece). They are the driving factors, while the technological advancements in video and computation act as tools supplementing and enhancing them. 

For analytics to be successful, it needs data. How do you get data? By playing the game. So analytics proponents want to see the game played as much as anyone else. Put this in with rule changes and scheduling.

That level of analytics has had a place in the game for a long time and would have continued to, even without the technical revolution that has allowed for innovation in many different industries, not just sports. 

Video tech and video coordinators. 

Other possible paths. Could have taken longer for analytics to be adopted.
