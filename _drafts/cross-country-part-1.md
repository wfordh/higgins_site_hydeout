My siblings and I recently completed a cross country drive in order to be with family for the holidays. It was interesting for a variety of reasons, of course including how the mere circumstances of the drive sound like a made for TV movie. Siblings driving home for the holidays in the middle of a pandemic! Oh, and there's a super intense election going on! We had some interesting stops along the way, and seeing the progression of how seriously people were taking COVID at those stops was both fascinating and terrifying.
