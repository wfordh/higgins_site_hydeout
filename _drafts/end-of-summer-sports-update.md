I'm trying to write more often and probably the easiest way to make that happen is writing a bit about sports. There has certainly been a lot going on in the sports world, and while it hasn't been enough to distract from everything else going on in the world, it's been great to watch. The MLB season is winding down, the NBA Finals are about to start, and both footballs have kicked off their seasons, along with their fantasy seasons.

The A's clinched their first AL West division title since 2013 and finish as the 2 seed in the AL and fourth best record in all of baseball. Their reward? Facing a Chicago White Sox team that finished only one game behind them in win/loss percentage but are the 7 seed because the AL Central was very good and they lost the tiebreaker with Cleveland. Both of those teams are decidedly better than the 6th seeded Astros and probably better than the 5 seed Yankees. To top it off, the A's get the juicy noon TV slot for the first two games. As usual, we'll have to make our own luck. 

I don't feel great about our chances considering we're without Matt Chapman, a bunch of hitters had been slumping until recently, and two of our three best starters are lefties when the White Sox crush lefties. Honestly though, I'm not sure I could say how the team looks since I've mostly been watching basketball over the A's games. At least the noon time slots won't conflict with any NBA Finals games!

The Finals are about to start and it's an underdog Miami Heat team against LeBron's Lakers. I can't help but think we already know how this is going to go, but maybe Spo, Jimmy G. Buckets, and Bam can make it interesting. The Nuggets did nearly take Game 2 from the Lakers and had _so many chances_ in Game 5. It will be an interesting stylistic battle at the least and should be an enjoyable series as long as the narratives around it don't get too out of control. It has been a lot of fun watching Murray and Jokic team up and get this far, and it was vintage LeBron in the closeout game where he just wasn't letting the Lakers lose. 

Now he'll be matched up against a fierce competitor in Butler and old foe Andre Iguodala, though I suspect he and Frank Vogel will target Dragic, Robinson, and Herro whenever possible. Whether or not Spo will be able to keep those guys on the floor over better defensive options will be an interesting subplot, but I think the Bam against AD matchup will be what I watch the most.

Fantasy football is in full swing and my team is _hurting_. Saquon is done for the season and my running back group is, um, subpar. Myles Gaskin is now my RB1 and my depth is being tested every week. I think I'll get my first win of the season this week and maybe [win a side bet, too](https://twitter.com/wfordh/status/1310435261881360384), but it's not looking good long term. I want to swing some trades, but have not really found any takers. This week it'll be attempting to get off of Jared Cook and maybe AJ Green, and potentially selling high on Keenan Allen.
