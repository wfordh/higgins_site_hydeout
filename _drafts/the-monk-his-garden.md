The monk swung his legs off his bed, already frowning from a poor night of sleep. He hadn't thought of himself as a monk in years. A gardener, a poet, a hermit, and even one time a lover, but no longer a monk. He rubbed his eyes and looked over at his small desk. Sure enough, the book containing his holy notes was still there, accidentally unearthed the previous evening from piles of old letters and recipes. He turned his eyes away, not wanting to remember those days.

As he stood to begin his day, hoping to rid his thoughts of gods and holy rites, his ears perked up at an unusual noise. Was that a voice?
