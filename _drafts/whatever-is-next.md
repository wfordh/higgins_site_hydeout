Last week I was [laid off](https://twitter.com/wfordh/status/1329887120148852744) from [Scoop](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6737089974644158464/). It sucks that our country has handled the pandemic so poorly that many things are not even close to normal. The state of things certainly impacted Scoop, especially as a transportation company, and of course impacted me. I really enjoyed my time at Scoop and in particular my analytics teammates. We were a model team and the camaraderie we had is not something I'll forget soon. In fact, it might make my next job that much tougher because it will be measured against such a high standard. Anyway, enough of that as everyone has their own horror stories from 2020.

I have worked on a couple different [fantasy football tools](https://twitter.com/wfordh/status/1331394026357010433) to help me in addition to reading FantasyPros and The Athletic articles. I was able to get both of them off the ground before the season ended, which is pretty exciting considering I've had an awkward habit of not finishing these sorts of things until after the season. They are both command line Python scripts that take a couple of arguments and then print out some JSON blobs of information to the terminal. Neither one is very complicated and they mainly leverage the [Sleeper API](https://docs.sleeper.app/) to get the league information. It's really helpful that Sleeper has all of that data available, and there's even a [Python wrapper](https://pypi.org/project/sleeper-api-wrapper/) to the API, though it looks like it hasn't been updated in a while. 

The first one pulls all of the user's scores from the previous weeks and calculates and "expected" record / win percentage based on how many teams each team would have beaten that week. It's a simple way to keep the context of the weekly scores and seasonality of the NFL, but make the records independent of the weekly matchups. On top of that, it provides a rest of season strength of schedule for each team by averaging their remaining opponents' expected win percentage.

The second one is meant to help with waivers and finding players to add/drop. Unfortunately, Sleeper has restricted access to their stats projections at the behest of their stats provider, so I'm currently pulling in Numberfire's projections. The script pulls in all of the free agents and rostered players in our league, add the projections, and then compares the free agents to the players on my roster to see which players have better rest of season projections than those on my roster.
