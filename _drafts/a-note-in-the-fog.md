The fog was creeping up the ravine even faster with the sun setting over the ocean's horizon, putting a timer on his actions. If he didn't make his way down to the docks now, then he may never have the chance again. Henri scanned the note again, still struggling to comprehend all it said in just a matter of lines.

* note contains info that his great-grandfather was the king and he had a child born out of wedlock with a woman of the council, which forced them to keep it hush hush. Soon thereafter, the king was killed and his brother ascended to the throne, so Henri's grandfather was whisked away to safety and anonymity. This fact was discovered, and the current king and council wishes him to either accept a reduced role in court (where they can keep an eye on him) or enter a monastery (or have some accident befall him).
* His own father has been dead a while, but his mother worked as a cobbler and actress in the local theatre
* being forced down out of the mountains, where they had advanced, but tyrant has restricted scientific exploration to his interests. Henri's culture had stuck to traditional stuff and had been more isolated, so hadn't been poisoned by tyrants wishes as much.
