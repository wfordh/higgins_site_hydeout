I read this [post on fixing Goodreads](https://prepend.com/culture/2020/09/fixing_goodreads.html) over the weekend and followed it up with this [article](https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/social-media/2020/08/better-goodreads-possible-bad-for-books-storygraph-amazon) about Goodreads' negative impact on books. I started using Goodreads last year to help me track which books I've read, and while I don't use it for the community at all, the user experience is quite frustrating at times. Things are clunky and not always responsive, and as mentioned in both pieces, the search functionality is _horrendous_. The book I'm searching for will pop up and then disappear if I type another letter, or only return the book if I type out the full title. 

The second article directed me towards [The Storygraph](https://beta.thestorygraph.com/), a new Goodreads competitor that promises to be different than all their other competitors. I might try them out soon, but regardless of whether or not I do, hopefully Amazon doesn't crush them at the first hint of success. 

I bring all of this up since I recently came up with an idea for something that fits somewhere between its own product and a feature for a Goodreads-style product. The idea is simple - in addition to having a list of all the books you've read, are reading, and want to read, you also have a list of books that are on your physical (or digital?) bookshelf and are willing to loan. It could help neighbors share books and build the community through reading, creating an auxiliary, decentralized library to your neighborhood.

Users could decide against listing titles they don't want to share and would be encouraged to loan books instead of selling them. I think that could strengthen the bond between loaner and loanee, though of course you could also have a system with demerits for losing or damaging a loaned book.

I'm sure something similar already exists - Craigslist isn't far off and neither is Nextdoor - but I think there might be room for this idea somewhere. It could even extend to a few other types of goods, though then it might truly be getting into Nextdoor territory.

Some other things I'm reading:

* [The Drunkard's Walk](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/115699/the-drunkards-walk-by-leonard-mlodinow/)
* [Freiburg: Germany's futuristic city set in a forest](http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20200715-freiburg-germanys-futuristic-city-set-in-a-forest)

Not a lot of uplifting stuff in there, though the Freiburg piece was über cool (see what I did there?).

What I'm doing:

* Manually filling out my dataset for my NBA salary analysis
* Working on fantasy sports stuff
* Finally starting [Bayesian Methods for Hackers](https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers)

I might try to learn some woodworking stuff sometime. It seems pretty cool, but I have no clue how to do that and there's some other stuff earlier on the to do list.
