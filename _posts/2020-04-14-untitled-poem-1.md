I wrote this poem today. It came to me after I went for a walk because I could not find the focus or motivation to do much work. 

***

It is a clear day  
In the city by the bay  
Please, Karl, stay away  
  
We do not need your doom  
We do not need your gloom  
After all,  
We get enough of that from Zoom  
  
I wonder if the city knows  
Does it recognize our woes?  
Adapt to daily life’s new flows  
  
The speed of our new pace  
Everyone confined to their own space  
A personal dormitory  
A personal purgatory?  
  
If it did, would it tell us?  
Thank us for this respite  
From screeching cable cars and too full buses  
And tech’s amoral despots?  
  
Tell us to enjoy the views  
From Sutro, Twin Peaks, and the Nobs  
All better than a trip to Bob’s  
Donut crumbs leaving a trail of clues  
  
Hints to enjoy more -  
Learn Haight Street’s lore  
Or dive into the city’s tales  
Of Ohlone, missions, and humpback whales  
  
After all, it is a clear day  
In the city by the bay  
A rare occasion  
In its equation
