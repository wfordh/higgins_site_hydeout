All sports-focused posts will appear here. While there will likely be overlap between some posts that contain both data science/statistics and sports, any that contain sports will likely be placed here.

Some common topics will like include the following:

* NBA: Analytics, Philosophy, some occasional player breakdowns/opinions, and Xs and Os
* NBA G-League: Similar to above, but likely without much, if any, Xs and Os or player breakdowns
* College basketball: I love watching my Davidson Wildcats and also enjoy keeping tabs on top NBA draft prospects
* Oakland A's: My favorite team that I'll likely always keep coming back to no matter what
