These posts will be focused on data science, statistics, and computer science, though what exactly that entails is to be determined. They will likely primarily be about theory with applications embedded within the posts, or questions about the ethics or directions the fields are taking.

My masters program was extremely informative about not just what data science is or the methods behind it, but also where and how to look for resources on topics of interest. I hope this blog will serve a dual purpose of both being a resource for others and showing my continued exploration through the domain. There are fascinating new ideas in data science coming up all the time and I hope to continue learning about them so I can continue improving as a data scientist.
